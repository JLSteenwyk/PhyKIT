Major changes to PhyKIT are summarized here.

1.6.0
  - Added tip_to_tip_distance (alias: t2t_dist; t2t) function to calculate
  phylogenetic distance between two leaves in a phylogeny

1.5.0
  - Added root_tree (alias: root; rt) function to root a phylogenetic tree

1.4.0
  - PhyKIT is now Python version 3.9 and BioPython 1.79 compatible

1.3.0
  - Added function that estimates the evolutionary rate of a gene using
  tree-based properties. Function name is 'evolutionary_rate' or 'evo_rate' 

1.2.2
  - Added function to get the subtree of the last common ancestor among
  a set of taxa

1.2.0
  - Added command line interfaces for all functions so that each command 
  can more easily be executed. For example, 'phykit aln_len -h' can now be
  called using 'pk_aln_len -h'

1.1.2
  - Added faidx (alias: get_entry; ge) function to extract fasta entries
  from a multi-fasta file

1.1.0
  - Added faidx (alias: get_entry; ge) function to extract fasta entries
  from a multi-fasta file

1.0.3
  - Added rooting procedure before calculating RF to handle comparing
  unrooted and rooted trees

1.0.2
  - function that calculates Robinson Foulds distance (robinson_foulds_distance;
  rf_distance; rf_dist; rf) now can take trees that differ in topology. PhyKIT
  will first determine shared tips between the two trees and prune both trees
  to a common set of tips. Next, PhyKIT will calculate the Robinson Foulds 
  distance.


0.1.3
  - Added function (column_score; cs) to calculate the quality of
    an alignment given an input query alignment and a reference
    alignment to compare it to

0.1.2
  - Added function (sum_of_pairs_score; sops; sop) to calculate
    the quality of an alignment given an input query alignment
    and a reference alignment to compare it to

0.0.9
  - PhyKIT now handles error stemming from piping output
