`Antonis Rokas <https://as.vanderbilt.edu/rokaslab/>`_ is the Cornelius Vanderbilt Chair in 
Biological Sciences and Director of the `Evolutionary Studies Initiative 
<https://www.vanderbilt.edu/evolution/>`_ at `Vanderbilt University <https://www.vanderbilt.edu/>`_.
Research in his laboratory focuses on the study of the DNA record to gain insight into the patterns and 
processes of evolution. Using a combination of computational and experimental approaches, his lab’s current
research aims to understand the molecular foundations of the fungal lifestyle, the reconstruction of the
tree of life, and the evolution of human pregnancy. Find out more information at his 
`laboratory’s website <https://as.vanderbilt.edu/rokaslab/>`_.

I am a postdoctoral scholar at Vanderbilt University in the lab of Dr. Antonis Rokas. My research
uses evolution to understand the relationship between phenotype, genotype, and environment. This
includes the evolution of human birth timing and disorders of pregnancy, and the evolution of silent
codon positions in yeasts. During my research career I have worked with fungi, humans, beetles, fishes,
limpets, clams, and lizards! For more information visit her `personal website <abigailleavittlabella.com>`_.

`Xing-Xing Shen <https://xingxingshen.github.io/>`_ is an Assistant Professor of Institute of
Insect Sciences at Zhejiang University. His lab is broadly interested in evolutionary biology,
phylogenetics, comparative genomics, and bioinformatics. His current research mainly focus on:
1) investigating phylogenetic relationships in animals and fungi using genome-scale data;
2) identifying the factors that lead to phylogenetic incongruence;
and 3) exploring insect species and ecological diversity. Find out more information at his
