^^^^^

PhyKIT can be used for a multitude of different types of analyses. Documentation here 
provides a step-by-step outline for how to conduct three different types of analyses.

1. summarizing information content among multiple sequence alignments and phylogenies for diagnostic purposes,
2. evaluating gene-gene covariation to identify genes of shared function and screen for novel gene function, and
3. identify polytomies in species phylogenies, which are suggestive of rapid radiation or diversification events

PhyKIT implements numerous functions that can be used to examine the information content and help researchers 
identify biases in multiple sequence alignments and phylogenies
