Phylogenetics and Phylogenomics toolKIT

Currently, the following functions are implemented in PhyKIT:
• treeness
• total tree length
• internode labeler
• LB score
• alignment length calculation
• number of variable sites calculation; percent variable sites
• number of parsimony informative sites calculation; percent parsimony informative sites
• Average internal branch length
• Aln. length after removing any site with gaps
• dvmc
• average bipartition support
• patristic distance determination
• rcv
• plain robinson-foulds distance; normalized robinson-foulds distance
• treeness / rcv
• protein-to-nucleotide (pal2nal) alignment conversion
• long termini (terminal branches with tips longer than xx the median terminal branch length)
• create concatenation matrix
• print ascii tree
• print tree tip names
• rename tree tips
• rename names in alignments
• GC content calculation
• A proxy of evolutionary rate https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/9/8/1998/4060518
• branch length multiplier
• correlated gene-gene evolution
• Saturation
• Create function to prune tips from a tree

Consider writing a function that conducts objective desirability-based integration of multiple statistics
