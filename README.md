Phylogenetics and Phylogenomics toolKIT

Currently, the following functions are implemented in PhyKIT:
• treeness
• total tree length
• internode labeler
• LB score
• alignment length calculation
• number of variable sites calculation; percent variable sites
• number of parsimony informative sites calculation; percent parsimony informative sites
• Average internal branch length
• Aln. length after removing any site with gaps
• dvmc

Functions to add include:
• CAM site determination https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3956930/
• rcv
• treeness / rcv
• average bipartition support
• tip-to-tip distance determination
• protein-to-nucleotide alignment conversion
• dvmc (degree of violation of the molecular clock)
• robinson-foulds distance determination
• create concatenation matrix


Consider writing a function that conducts objective desirability-based integration of multiple statistics
