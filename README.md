Phylogenetics and Phylogenomics toolKIT

Currently, the following functions are implemented in PhyKIT:
• treeness
• total tree length
• internode labeler

Functions to add include:
• alignment length calculation
• number of variable sites calculation
• percent variable sites
• number of parsimony informative sites calculation
• percent parsimony informative sites
• Aln. length after removing any site with gaps
• Average internal branch length

Consider writing a function that conducts objective desirability-based integration of multiple statistics
