`Jacob L. Steenwyk <https://jlsteenwyk.github.io/>`_ is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute
Gilliam fellow in the `Antonis Rokas Laboratory <https://as.vanderbilt.edu/rokaslab/>`_ at
`Vanderbilt University <https://www.vanderbilt.edu/>`_. His research foci include understanding 
the parameters that influence genome stability, the genomics of microbial domestication, and 
the evolution of pathogenicity. Beyond research, Steenwyk aims to make education more accessible 
through diverse avenues of community engagement. Find out more information at his

`Antonis Rokas <https://as.vanderbilt.edu/rokaslab/>`_ is the Cornelius Vanderbilt Chair in 
Biological Sciences and Director of the `Evolutionary Studies Initiative 
<https://www.vanderbilt.edu/evolution/>`_ at `Vanderbilt University <https://www.vanderbilt.edu/>`_.
Research in his laboratory focuses on the study of the DNA record to gain insight into the patterns and 
processes of evolution. Using a combination of computational and experimental approaches, his lab’s current
research aims to understand the molecular foundations of the fungal lifestyle, the reconstruction of the
tree of life, and the evolution of human pregnancy. Find out more information at his 
`laboratory’s website <https://as.vanderbilt.edu/rokaslab/>`_.

`Abigail L. LaBella <https://www.abigailleavittlabella.com/>`_  am a postdoctoral scholar at Vanderbilt University in the 
lab of Dr. Antonis Rokas. Her research uses evolution to understand the relationship between phenotype, genotype, and environment. 
This includes the evolution of human birth timing and disorders of pregnancy, and the evolution of silent
codon positions in yeasts. During her research career she has worked with fungi, humans, beetles, fishes,
limpets, clams, and lizards! For more information visit her `personal website <https://www.abigailleavittlabella.com/>`_.
